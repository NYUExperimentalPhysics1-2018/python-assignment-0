This repository contains Python assignment 0 for NYU Intro Experimental Physics 1, Fall 2018.

The repository contains the following files:
-	README.md – this readme
-	MIT6_0001F16_Getting_Start.pdf – a guide to setting up anaconda python and spyder from the MIT OCW course
-	MIT6_0001F16_ProblemSet0.pdf – problem set 0 from the MIT OCW course. Please complete the assignment as listed in the pdf, with the corrections below
-	Pkgtest.py – test to make sure your Python distribution is running correctly. Open it in Spyder and hit the run button (green arrow/F5). You should get a graph titled ‘Earthquake Magnitude in Japan from 3/9-3/12’ in the IPython console window
-	ps0.py – starter template for your assignment; edit this file to complete the assignment, commit your changes, then push them back to GitHub
-	baseball.py – Python code I wrote to calculate and plot the trajectory of a baseball in the absence of air resistance. It is meant to demonstrate style conventions I would like you to follow in this course
-	Intro Experimental Physics Python Guidelines.pdf – style guidelines and list of resources


For this first assignment, do not worry too much about style. Just try to get working code and get it submitted on time.
