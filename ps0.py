# replace this commented section with your source code
# when you run the code, it should ask for 2 numbers, x&y
# then it should print out x^y and log_2(x)
# see handout: MIT6_0001F16_ProblemSet0.pdf in this directory for instructions
#

#optional extensions: 
#   check to make sure x > 0 and re-prompt user if a negative value is entered
#   ask the user if (s)he wants to run the program again and loop until the answer is 'n'
#   ask the user for a name and call the user by name when asking for input
